# Beta-Bank

Beta Bank's customers are leaving: little by little, slipping away every month. The bankers have discovered that it's cheaper to save existing customers than to attract new ones.
We need to predict whether a customer will leave the bank soon. You have data on past customer behavior and contract terminations with the bank.
Build a model with the maximum possible F1 value. To pass the review, you need an F1 value of at least 0.59 for the test data set.
Also, measure the AUC-ROC metric and compare it with the F1 value.
